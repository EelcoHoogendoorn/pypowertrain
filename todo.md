Tentative list of possible future work:

* grow library of parts
* find more empirical data to link against
* add more scaling laws, and validate existing ones

* futher generalize optimization functionality; custom loss functions, etc
* unify system and bike classes. generalize 'bike' to 'vehicle' base class?
* add examples of other physical systems; prop-motor matching, etc
* improve thermal modelling functionality; define thermal resistances between motor parts and solve that?
* specify motor mass components as fractions, for easier defaults
* work out current stub gearing module

* add iron saturation modelling
* improve inrunner support
* improve variable reluctance support
* add induction motors and controllers?
